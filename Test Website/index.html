			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hello everyone, my name is Ronald Finn and I am a 21 year old student who is attending University of Central Florida. I have already recieved my Associates degree, and now in my junior year of college I am studying Digital Media. I love learning about photography, cinematography, and programs like Photoshop and Illustrator. Outside of school, I love to watch sports and play video games. I also enjoy going out meeting new people from time to time.

			<h3>What I Do For Work</h3>
			<p>Currently, I am a full time student at UCF and I work in a pizza shop when I am not in class. My goal is to focus on getting good grades and learn as much material as I can. In the future, I could see myself helping others to build websites as a business, but since this is my first time learning HTML, the focus is to soak up as much as possible. I also want to take professional photos and film promotional videos. Peter Mckinnon is a successful youtuber who helps others by sharing informational videos on softwares like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premier Pro. He is somebody that I look up to because I learn a lot of tips from him, and I would love to share the same profession. I will leave a link to his website down below.</p>
